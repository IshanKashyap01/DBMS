# Key-Value NoSQL Database

- *Easy to retrieve* data as it has a *built-in caching mechanism*

- Uses a very *simple* data structure as value is a black box

- Very high *scalability* due to simplistic design

- It can used for big collections of:

  - array-like data such as a dictionary (associative arrays)

  - JSON data files

  - Unstructured data

- For ex. Amazon DynamoDB, Oracle NoSQL, Aerospike, REDIS, Amazon AWS

## Limitations

- It is not good if there will be *heavy updates on data*

- Does not support relationship among multiple data

- Queries are performed one key at a time
