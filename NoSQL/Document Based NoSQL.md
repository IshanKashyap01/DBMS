# Document Based NoSQL

- It is very simple as it stores data in ```JSON```, ```BSON``` or ```XML```
documents

- It works on semi-structured data as each document has **key-value pairs**

- It is preferred for creating *backend for APIs*

- Just like other NoSQL DBs, it is *horizontally scalable*

- It supports SQL and other query languages and **ACID properties**

- It is *schema-less* and has built-in *versioning* for files

- However, it cannot enforce *integrity constraints*

- For ex. MongoDB, Postgres, Amazon DocumentDB, Cosmo DB etc.
