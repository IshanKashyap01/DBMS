# Introduction to NoSQL

- NoSQL stands for **Not Only SQL** as it is used for not just structured data

- RDBMS can operate *only on structured* whereas NoSQL can operate on *semi and*
*unstructured data as well*

- A NoSQL database can be using any of the following data models:

    1. Document

    2. Graph

    3. Key-value

    4. Graph

## Advantages of NoSQL over RDBMS

- It is **horizontally scalable**

- It has higher availability as most NoSQL DBs support **auto replication**

- Due to lack of structural constraints, it is *easy to read/write data*

  - Additionally, for the same reason, it can have more *flexible schemas* (ex. JSON)

- It is easier to determine matrix, dashboard and analytics in NoSQL

- It has *low to zero management* requirements due to auto-repair data distribution

- It has very **high throughput** in read/write operations

## Disadvantages of NoSQL over RDBMS

- Due to lack of a rigid schema, it *lacks integrity constraints*

- Due to lack of integrity constraints, it also *lacks ACID properties* and hence,
cannot be used for transactions

- RDBMS is more efficient for *frequent updation and deletion* of data
