# Graph Based NoSQL Database

- It can store *structured*, *semi-structured* as well as *unstructured* data

- Data is stored as graphs by using **nodes for data** and **edges for relationships**

- It is used in *social network, recommendation engine* and *fraud detection*

- Its biggest advantage is that it can be used to identify and uncover *relationships*
*among different entities*

-Query speed usually depends on the number of *relationships* and is independent
of the *amount of data* to be processed.

- However, it has no standard language available; each DB has its own
