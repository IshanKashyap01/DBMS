# Clustering

- Clustering is done by *replicating the database* into multiple systems

- This provides *additional security* by adding redundancy to the system

- It allows *load balancing* i.e. sends the query to the least busy server

- Database clusters are of the following types:

    1. High-performance clusters

    2. Load balancing clusters

    3. Failover/high availability clusters

- Most websites uses clustering via **CDN** as it *increases availability*

- CDN stands for **Content Delivery Network**

- CDN allows multiple servers to host the same data so that

- This allows users regardless of their geographical locations, can access data
quickly

- Hence, availability is increased while response times are decreased
