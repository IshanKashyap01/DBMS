# Introduction to Set Operations

## Need of Set Operations

To combine resultsets from different *select* statements and:

1. Remove duplicates
2. Create distinct rows

## Difference b/w Sets and Joins

- Sets require *same order of attributes and types* to work unlike joins
- Unlike sets, for joins to work, conditions such as a common key must be met
- Joins generate distinct columns whereas sets generate distinct rows

## Set Operations in MySQL

1. UNION/UNION ALL
2. Intersection
3. Minus
