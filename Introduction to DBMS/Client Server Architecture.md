# Client Server Architecture

Databases revolve around two things: client and server, which is common between all
the tiers of DBMS architecture. This architecture has three tiers.

## Tier-1 Architecture

Here, the client and server reside in the same device.

## Tier-2 Architecture

Here, multiple clients have a direct access to the DBMS.

## Tier-3 Architecture

Here, a server acts as a bridge b/w clients and the actual database. This is better
for security as in case of an attack only the server will be lost while the DBMS
will remain intact.
