# Entity

- It is any object in our system
- It is depicted by a **rectangle** in an ER diagram
- A set of same entites at any given instance is called an **entity set**

## Strong Entities

They can be uniquely identified by one of their attributes

## Weak Entities

- They do not have an attribute that can act as a *primary key*
- These entities depend on **parent entities** for uniqueness
- They are represented by a **double rectange**
