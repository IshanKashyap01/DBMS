# Introduction to Normalisation

- It is a process for organising data in a database by breaking big tables into
smaller tables

- It is used to minimise redundancies and eliminate anomalies by removing unnecessary
dependencies

- There are multiple **normal forms**, each further decreases redundancies and
improves the overall design

## Anomalies in Databases

Anomalies refer to unintended results caused due to data redundancies

### Updation Anomaly

It occurs when updation of a single data value requires multiple rows to be updated

### Insertion Anomaly

It occurs when we cannot add a new tuple due to lack of data

### Deletion Anomaly

It occurs when deletion of data results in unintended loss of some other important
data
