# Types of Dependencies

## Functional Dependency

An attribute is said to be *functionally dependent* on other attribute, when
its value can be determined from the other attribute

## Fully Functional Dependency

When an attribute is *functionally dependent* on another attribute but none of its
proper subsets

## Partial Dependency

It occurs when a non-key attribute is dependent on some, but not all columns of
a composite key

## Transitive Dependency

It occurs when a non-key column depends on any other non-key column
