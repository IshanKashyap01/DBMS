# Data Models

Data models help us logically structure our databases, then build up on three
layers of data model to actually come up with a database.

## Conceptual Data Model

This is the highest level of data models. Here we decide:

- We identify the type of data we will need to store
- We explore the DBMS we should use
- Basic constraints needed
- Example: ER diagrams

## Representational Data Model

- Here, we decide on how we are going to arrange our data i.e. the logical
structure of our database.
- We decide the data types and their sizes
- This helps us design the DB in a proper way before implementation
- Example: Relational data model

## Physical Data Model

- Here, we specify where we actually store the data
- We specify the DBMS we are going to use along with its version
- We elaborate on all the constraints and relationships
