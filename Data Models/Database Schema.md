# Database Schema

- A schema is a logical representation of data in a DB
- It contains a list of attributes
- It contains instructions to the DB and how to organize data
- It defines relation b/w elements stored inside the DB

## Why Schema?

- It provides structure to the DB
- It is just a structural view of the DB and does not actually has the data
- While the data keeps changing within, the schema almost always remains the same

## Instances

- A schema defines the variables of a database (columns/fields/constraints etc)
- The value of these variables at any given moment of time is called an instance
- Each change, however small, is a new state to a table, and hence, is a new instance.
