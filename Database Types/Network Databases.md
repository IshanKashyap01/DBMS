# Network Databases

- It is a *modified* way of hierarchical database that allows *N:M* relations as
well

- It supports *multiple* direct relationships b/w entities

- Hence, it can handle more *complex* relations than hierarchical databases

- However, *maintaining* the database is a very tedious task

- It will have *deletion and updation anomalies* due to so many relationships

- It does not have much community support
