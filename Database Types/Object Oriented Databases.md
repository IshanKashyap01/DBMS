# Object Oriented Databases

- Data is stored in the form of *Objects* like any Object oriented language

- It combines the benefits of:

  - OOPS such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and object identity with
  
  - RDBMS features like transaction control, ACID and integrity constraints

- It uses an *Object oriented data model*

- It has the following main components:
    1. ```Objects``` : either built-in or user defined
    2. ```Classes``` : schema/blueprint for classes
    3. ```Methods``` : determines the behaviour of classes
    4. ```Pointers```: retrieves elements and defines relations b/w them

## Advantages

- It automatically assigns ```object ID``` and can store and retrieve complex data

- Everything related to OOPS works perfectly with Object Oriented laguages like
Java

## Disadvantages

- Due to higher complexity of data, DML operations are much slower

- It does not have a lot of support as it is not used by a large audience
