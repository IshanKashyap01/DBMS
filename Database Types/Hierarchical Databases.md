# Hierarchical Databases

- Stores data in a hierarchical format, where data is in either 1:1 or 1:N relationship

- Additionally, it means *referential integrity is already built-in*

- It also leads to *quick data retrieval* link

- However, a child entry **must** have a parent entry, otherwise it cannot be added

- Due to this format's limitation, *complex relationships cannot be shown*
