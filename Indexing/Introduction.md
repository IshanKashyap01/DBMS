# Introduction to Indexing

- It is used when we have large amounts of data and we want to **speed up** our *data
retrieval* performance

- It optimise performance by minimizing *number of disk accesses* required for queries

- This is done by *changing the way data is stored* in the disk

- It is a type of data structure with a **search key** and a corresponding **data**
**reference**

## Types of Indexing

1. Primary Indexing

    - Dense Indexing

    - Sparse Indexing

2. Clustering Indexing

3. Secondary Indexing

## Drawbacks of Indexing

- It is *heavy on space* as may require a lot of search keys

- As it changes the way data is stored, DML operations are also affected
and *potentially slowed*
